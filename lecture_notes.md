Python identifies code blocks through common tab structure
* Python is going to force you to be structured
* Even one space off can mess up your program
* Be wary of tool usage

1. Use the tab key
2. Do not mix tabs and space when defining a code block
3. Python uses 4 space as indentation by default

### Syntax Structures
1. One of the really nice things about Python Structure is a more regular syntax
2. The major structures are all very similar, close to the same as english language
